OpenSWave is an Open Source Implementation of the Adobe Shockwave Player for Linux/Unix platforms. As you may know, Shockwave is only available for Windows and Mac, which leaves us without any of the 3D games.

OpenSWave is licensed under the GNU GPLv3. Because it is open source, anyone can check the code and correct some bugs/errors that may be in it.

Here's some of the technologies we plan to use:
NPAPI - A MUST to make plugins for almost all web browsers (Except IE, but that doesn't matter)
GTK - Awesome widget library
GDK/Cairo - 2D Graphics
OpenGL - 3D Graphics Library
GStreamer - An open source library that will play the audio for us (yay!)
