note: Official RoadMap File. When done with an item, add --DONE to the end of it.

1. Get Blank Plugin associated with .dcr --DONE
2. Get GTK in NPAPI to draw --DONE
3. Open .dcr file and get media
4. Find way of getting script from .dcr
5. Link with GDK to draw onto screen
6. Link with gstreamer to play audio

Plans on finding out how to open .dcr: Download IDA Pro Free in WINE, and decompile Adobe Shockwave 11.
